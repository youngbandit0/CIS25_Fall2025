//Total Cost Calculator
//Description
//This C++ program calculates the total cost of an item based on user input. It prompts the user for:
//Item name (can include spaces)
//Quantity of the item
//Cost per item
/It then calculates and displays the total cost in a readable format with two decimal places.


//How to Run
//Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like g++, or use an IDE like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio).
//Save the program in a file, e.g., total_cost.cpp.
//Compile the program:
//g++ total_cost.cpp -o total_cost
//Run the program:
//./total_cost
//Enter the item details as prompted.

//Example
//Enter item name: Chocolate Bar
//Enter quantity: 3
//Enter cost per item: $2.50
//Total cost for "Chocolate Bar": $7.50


//Notes
//The program uses getline() to allow multi-word item names.
//Input validation for negative values is not included in this version.
