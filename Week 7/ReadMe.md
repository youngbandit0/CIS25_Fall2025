## ğŸ“˜ Overview

This program demonstrates:
- Use of a **struct** (`Item`) containing a `string` name and an `int` ID.
- **Dynamic memory allocation** using `new` and `delete[]`.
- **Populating** an array of Items sorted by **name**.
- Performing a **binary search** on a separate array of pointers sorted by **ID**.
- Clean memory deallocation before program exit.

It fulfills the assignment requirements to:
> Define a struct named `Item` with two members (`name` and `id`),  
> dynamically allocate an array of 100+ records,  
> populate it with sorted data,  
> use binary search by ID,  
> display the result,  
> and free memory.
