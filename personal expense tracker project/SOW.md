## 1. Project Overview
I’m creating a Personal Expense Tracker in C++. The program will let users log their expenses, categorize them (like Food, Rent, Entertainment), and see their total spending. Everything will be saved to a file so users can come back later and continue tracking.

## 2. Goals
- Build a working expense tracker using C++  
- Let users add, view, and delete expenses  
- Categorize expenses and calculate totals  
- Save and load data from a file  
- Make a clean, organized GitHub submission  

---

## 3. Deliverables
- Program files: `main.cpp`, `Expense.h`  
- `Output.pdf` with screenshots and explanations  
- GitHub repository with proper file structure  

---

## 4. Timeline
- **Week 1–2:** Set up GitHub and basic program structure  
- **Week 3–4:** Implement add/view/delete features and file saving/loading  
- **Week 5:** Test and debug the program  
- **Week 6:** Take screenshots and write `Output.pdf`  
- **Week 7:** Final review and submit

## 5. Success Criteria
The project will be successful if:  
- The program runs without errors  
- Users can add, view, and delete expenses correctly  
- Data is saved and loaded properly from the file  
- All required files are uploaded to GitHub on time
